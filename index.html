<!--Introduction-->
<section class="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I spend most of my money on things that will make me sparkle, smell good, or feel full (go figure). Thus, I am an amateur makeup enthusiast, perfumer, and foodie/cook. I run a little blog to document my perfume and makeup findings when I have time.</p>
  <p>I also have a burning passion for all life sciences and once dreamed of being a researcher or field biologist working on conservation. I love reading biology textbooks and science news.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I love learning and all things internet. I spend most of my waking hours on the computer! Most of the time, I'm reading something online to gain more knowledge in any and every subject. Falling into the Wikipedia rabbithole (clicking one link after another) and absorbing things that I previously did not know is one of my favorite pastimes.</p>

<!--Where I'm From-->
<section class="hometown">
  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in San Jose, but because I was mostly a homebody through grade school, I unfortunately don't know this area as well as Los Angeles, which is where I spent my college years.</p>

<!--About Me-->
<section class="aboutme">
  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I like to read, write/blog, and collect perfume.</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>I want something that will keep me decently challenged and interested everyday but also gives me enough time and pay to pursue outside-of-work hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and travel. I have many interests, so I can’t just pinpoint it down to one thing.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I’ve been listening to a lot of Ella Henderson. Her voice is amazing!</p>
